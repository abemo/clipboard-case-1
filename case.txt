Problems we tackle: shift offers.

Hey there! Thanks for the interest in joining Clipboard Health! We’re a group of scrappy 
problem solvers who are faced with ambiguous challenges every day. We expect team members 
to follow their curiosity, relish discomfort and think from first principles. We know we 
take a different approach to recruiting; you can read more about how we think about it here.

The upshot is, if you enjoy this case then it’s a good sign that you’ll like working with us.

Pretend like you’ve made it onto the CBH Product team and you’re looking for signal in our 
marketplace. Below you’ll find a link to a google drive with data from transactions on our 
marketplace. Along with the data, we’ve provided a glossary that defines the data for you.  

We’d like you to analyze the data however you’re comfortable, but we’d push you to try and 
share something you find truly interesting in the data. Present your findings to us in the 
form of a written brief. Nothing is off the table here, we’re eager to see what questions 
you come up with and how you seek to answer them.

Clipboard health is a two sided marketplace with strong network effects where workers transact 
with workplaces to book per diem shifts in the future. Workplaces post shifts and workers choose 
which shifts they’d like to work by booking them.
